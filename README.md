# Data Structure and Programming
This repository is where I practice implementing data structures using C or C++, and use Python3 to generate testcases to compare and analyze each data structure's usage of time and memory.

## Usage
```shell
# Change directory to the data structure you are interested in
$ cd ./{data_struct_dir}/{data_struct_series_dir}

# Compare the output generated by C or C++ with the golden output generated by Python3
# and check whether the output generated by C or C++ can pass all testcases
$ python3 compare.py
```
